## CREATE A TODO-APPLICATION (Using prisma)
-  install the typescript and do the standard steps
-   STEPS =>
    * npm init -y
    * npm install prisma typescript
    * npx tsc --init 
    * change outDir,rooDir
    * npx prisma init

then go to neon.tech and get the db connection string from there and paste it into the DATABASE_URL inside the .env file then prisma will automatically fetch the DB url from this file we don't need to import anything

ans then we will have a prisma folder inside that folder we will have schema.prisma file in that file we have to write the commands for the models (Look at the ./prisma/schema.prisma for the syntax of the model) means we have to create model there and then we have to run this command inside the termianl so that prisma will able to create the migration files 
        ```npx prisma migrate dev --name UserAndTodoAdded```

after --name GIVE_WHATEVER_NAME_YOU_WANTED
 
then we have use the functionality of prisma (autogenerated client)
        ```npx prisma generate```
